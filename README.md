# Formal Agent for Model Checking Software

- A LangChain AI agent implementation calling a local model checker (NuSMV) to temporal model check concurrent implementations expressed in a finite state machine description.
- NuSMV ((https://nusmv.fbk.eu)) is a symbolic model checker based on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs).
- I used OpenRouter (https://openrouter.ai) as a free API provider.
- A Mistral AI (https://mistral.ai) LLM is used as the reasoning model.
- I used ChatGPT (https://chatgpt.com/) for the most of the implementation.
