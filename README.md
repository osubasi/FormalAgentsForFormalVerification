# FormalAgent

- A LangChain AI agent implementation calling a local model checker (in this case NuSMV (https://nusmv.fbk.eu)) to temporal model check concurrent implementations expressed in a finite state machine description.
- OpenRouter (https://openrouter.ai) is used as a free API. 
- A Mistral AI (https://mistral.ai) LLM is used as the reasoning model.
- I used ChatGPT for the most of the implementation.
